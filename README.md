# GAN Integrity backend code challenge

The script `index.js` uses a local api to perform various operations on a set of cities. Your task is to implement an api so that the script runs successfully all the way to the end.

Run `npm install` and `npm run start` to start the script.

Your api can load the required data from [here](addresses.json).

In the distance calculations you can assume the earth is a perfect sphere and has a radius is 6371 km.

Once you are done, please provide us with a link to a git repo with your code, ready to run.

# Information on running the server.

In order to run the script `index.js` successfully, the server must be up and running locally. In order to do so:

- Run `npm i` in the terminal to install any new and necessary dependencies required by the server.

- You can run `npm run server` or `node server.js` to start the server in a terminal. Do not close it.

- After the server is up and running, run `npm install` and `npm run start` to start the script in a differnt terminal.
